## Data Revision Tracking
The system tracks data revisions over time:
- All historical changes to data points are stored in the `data_revisions` table
- Each revision records the dataset, date, field, old value, new value, and when the revision was detected
- This enables analysis of data reliability and correction patterns

## Usage
- View latest data with `python view_data.py --dataset [dataset_name]`
- List all available datasets with `python view_data.py --list`
- Run data collection with `python main.py`
- Test specific FRED indicators with `python test_fred_indicators.py`
- Test new GDP indicators with `python test_gdp_indicators.py`

## Data Storage
All data is stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL database with standardized schemas:
- Each dataset has its own table with consistent naming
- Common fields include: id, date, and the value column specific to that dataset
- Metadata about scraper runs is stored in the `scraper_metadata` table
- Data revisions are tracked in the `data_revisions` table

## Recent Additions
- **March 2025**: Added Real GDP and GDPNow forecast indicators
  - Real GDP: Quarterly data from FRED (GDPC1)
  - GDPNow: Atlanta Fed's real-time GDP forecast (GDPNOW)
